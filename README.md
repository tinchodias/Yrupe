# Yrupe

Yrupé is a serializer of [Ficus](https://github.com/tinchodias/Ficus) objects to/from git, based on libgit bindings by Max Leske.

⚠️Outdated code⚠️:
It was recovered from [smalltalkhub](http://smalltalkhub.com/MartinDias/Yrupe/). The [migration tool](https://github.com/pharo-contributions/git-migration) showed errors that I couldn't fix, so decided to push only latest snapshot.
