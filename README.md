# Yrupe

Yrupé is a serializer of [Ficus](https://github.com/tinchodias/Ficus) objects to/from git, based on libgit bindings by Max Leske.

⚠️Outdated code⚠️
The codebase is part of a prototype library that a mostly developed until 2015, during my Ph.D at Lille. I receovered the packages from Monticello format in [smalltalkhub](http://smalltalkhub.com/MartinDias/Yrupe/) to git. I tried to migrate all commits using [this migration tool](https://github.com/pharo-contributions/git-migration), but it showed errors that I couldn't fix, so finally pushed only latest snapshot.
